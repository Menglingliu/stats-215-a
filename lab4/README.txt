How to reproduce our report:

1. Go to the R/ folder and run all the R scripts there. They will run the necessary analysis and generate the plots needed in the report.
2. Put lab4.Rnw and the pdf plots generated in Step 1 (they are currently saved in the extra folder) in the same directory.
3. Compile lab4.Rnw to PDF.
