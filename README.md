# Stat 215a: Applied Statistics and Machine Learning

UC Berkeley

Applied statistics and machine learning, focusing on answering scientific questions using data, the data science life cycle, critical thinking, reasoning, methodology, and trustworthy and reproducible computational practice. Hands-on-experience in open-ended data labs, using programming languages such as R and Python. Emphasis on understanding and examining the assumptions behind standard statistical models and methods and the match between the assumptions and the scientific question. Exploratory data analysis. Model formulation, fitting, model testing and validation, interpretation, and communication of results. Methods, including linear regression and generalizations, decision trees, random forests, simulation, and randomization methods.


## Repository for submitting labs for STAT 215A Fall 2017

This repository contains a set file structure for submitting the projects.


## Setup



1. Install Git on your system (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

1. Sign up for GitHub (https://github.com/).

1. Go to https://education.github.com/ and sign up for the student pack to get unlimited private repositories. You are a "student" and you want an "individual account".

Once you have completed these first steps, you are then ready to create your private GitHub repository for this class.

1. Locally on your machine, clone my stat215a repository: `git clone https://github.com/rlbarter/stat215a`. This will create a copy of the repository on your own computer.

1. On the GitHub website, log in and create a **private** remote repository called *stat215a*. Add me (*rlbarter*) as a collaborator for this repository (check out settings on the repo website).

1. Back in the terminal, set the origin of your local repository to be the remote repository that you just made. Change USERNAME below to your username. This tells git which remote repository to push your changes to when you `git push` (`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/stat215a.git`).

1. Edit *info.txt* to reflect your own information.

```
name = "Jane Smith"
SID = "0123456789"
email = "jsmith@berkeley.edu"
github_name = "janesmith"
```

Now you're ready to push to your remote repository for the first time:

1. Check git status `git status`. You should see a bunch of text including `modified:   info.txt`.

1. Add (`git add info.txt`) and commit (`git commit -m “Updated info.txt with my own information”`) your edited *info.txt* file

1. Push your changes to your copy of the remote repository (`git push` or sometimes `git push remote origin`)

1. Check that info.txt has been updated in your remote github repository by navigating to https://github.com/USERNAME/stat215a (change USERNAME to your username)


## Submitting your lab report

You will submit your lab report by adding it to your local stat215a folder and then following the standard procedure; `git pull`, `git add lab1`, `git commit -m "Uploaded lab 1"`, `git push`.

Your lab should be contained in a folder called `lab1`, `lab2`, etc (depending on which lab you are submitting). The folder structure should be as follows:


```
lab1/
  data/
  extra/
  homework.pdf
  lab1.Rmd
  lab1.pdf
  lab1_blind.Rmd
  lab1_blind.pdf
  R/
```



- The source of your report (with code) will be contained in the `lab1.Rmd` file (`lab1.Rnw` is fine too).

- The compiled version of your report will be contained in `lab1.pdf`.

- You will also submit a "blind" version of each of these documents that does not include your name (`lab1_blind.Rmd` and `lab1_blind.pdf`).

- The `R/` folder will contain any extra R scripts needed to compile your report.

- The `data/` folder will contain any data you use for the lab. Note that in the instance that the data is a large file (over 100MB), you do not need to include it in the `data/` folder.

- The `homework.pdf` file will contain your completed homework. Please do not include any irrelevant files.

Note that GitHub cannot host files more than 100 MB. If you try to push a file larger than this, GitHub will cry.

When you are ready, you need to add, commit, and push the `lab1/` folder.

At the time when the lab is due, we will run a script that automatically pulls all of your assignments into my local versions of your `stat215a` repositories. Please make sure to submit your labs on time. We will spend some time in a lab having everyone submit a pretend assignment so that you are all clear on what to do.


This will push your lab to your own stat215a repository (https://github.com/USERNAME/stat215a). At the submission deadline, I will then pull from your repository (since I am a collaborator), so I should receive a local copy of your lab report. Shortly afterward, I will push a folder containing two papers for you to review and grade. To see this folder locally you will need to `git pull`. You will submit your completed feedback forms in the same way that you submitted your lab.
